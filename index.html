                <h2>Apple's Glacial Progress Toward USB C</h2>
                <p>Apple at their recent event announced that they'd be switching the AirPods Max to USB C finally, bringing lightning one step closer to the grave. They've been remarkably slow about this, so I'd like to list what's left here and update it
                    over time to track their progress. Here is everything Apple currently sells that still uses lightning (excluding cables and adapters):

                <ul>
                    <li>Apple Pencil 1st Gen</li>
                    <li>iPhone 14</li>
                    <li>iPhone SE</li>
                    <li>Magic Mouse</li>
                    <li>Magic Trackpad</li>
                    <li>Magic Keyboard</li>

                <h2>Why Google Chrome <em>Actually</em> Sucks for Privacy</h2>
                <p>I spend a lot of time in the "privacy" community and one thing it is absolutely allergic to is nuance. Case in point: Chrome is "spyware."
                </p>
                <p>This does nothing but cheapen the term spyware which should be reserved for heinous abuses of privacy like state actors exploiting the devices of journalists to gain info on them
                    or an abusive partner installing stalkerware to track everything their victim is doing.
                </p>
                <p>The <em>real</em> problems with Chrome are more specific. Now, credit where it's due, the Chrome security team are some of the best in the industry and they've created the most secure
                browser engine available; they should be recognized for their incredible work pushing browser security forward for everyone. If you want the most secure browser possible, you need
                one based on Chromium.
                </p>
                <p>That said, its two main competitors, Safari and Firefox, while having significantly lower install bases, completely wipe the floor with Chrome in terms of their privacy features.
                    Chrome has no option for E2EE sync for anything, so Google has full access to your browsing history, bookmarks, etc should you choose to enable syncing. Chrome doesn't have
                    any anti-fingerprinting features at all. In fact, not only does it lack any kind of fingerprint randomization, it also actively makes fingerprinting worse by implementing <a href="https://webkit.org/standards-positions/">lots of APIs</a>
                    that their competition doesn't for this exact reason. Why does a website need to know how much battery or RAM you have, or the orientation of your phone? It doesn't.
                </p>
                <p>WebKit has a page about the <a href="https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/">anti-tracking technologies</a> they implement. Firefox forms the basis of the Tor browser and they've been upstreaming Tor browser features for a long time.
                    These teams are the ones improving privacy on the web, not Chromium. Also worth noting the work Brave has done in implementing most of these same features in Chromium, proving it can be done
                    and that Google simply doesn't want to.
